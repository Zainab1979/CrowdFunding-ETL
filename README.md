# CrowdFunding-ETL
This project is part of  UCSD bootcamp. In this project we extracted data from CSV files, cleaned it and load it to database. We also wrote some queries to extracted information from the tables from database.
We used pandas for data extraction and regex for data cleaning uesing python. We used PostgreSQL and PGAdmin for database creation and queries.
